As part of the Responsive Web Design track at <a href="https://freecodecamp.org" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp</a> you are asked to create a responsive tribute web page. The main goal was to have an image that responds to changing view sizes, but I also focused a lot on having further adjustments to the page layout.

With media that has a width above 1600px, the image is placed to the left of the text. Below 1600px, the image is placed above the text and the width of the text area is increased as the device's width decreases (from 50%, to 80% under 1200px, to 90% under 800px, to 99% under 500px).

The design was entirely from scratch, with only the testing scripts provided by freeCodeCamp.
