A project completed in my 3rd semester, winter semester 2017/18. The project was with a team of two other students.

We were asked to create an app to be used in an insurance context. The goal was to make an app that allowed farmers to create GPS defined areas for their fields. Whenever a field was damaged, they could make the location and type of the damage.

Employees at the insurance company were then able to view the information provided by the farmer and assess the damages.

In addition to participating in the documentation and planning of the project, the GUI was largely completed by me as well as a lot of the logic associated with adding fields and damages to the app. As this was a project that we worked on in a small team, we all tried to participate in all parts when help was needed instead of entirely splitting up everything.
