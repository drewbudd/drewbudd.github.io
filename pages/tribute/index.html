        <p id="quote-info">Yu Gwan-sun from prison</p>
                    
        <p>When the Japanese military began their rule over Korea in 1905, Yu Gwan-sun wasn't even 3 years old. She never really knew an independent Korea, yet she gave everything she had to fight for it.</p>

        <p>Gwan-sun was an intelligent child and at a time in Korea's (and the whole world's) history where women rarely received an advanced education, she was encouraged to attend the Ehwa school in Seoul.</p>

        <p>In 1919, while Gwan-sun was still in high school, many Koreans were making a push for independence. On March 1, there were widespread protests through the entire country and on March 5 Gwan-sun participated in a student protest where she was detained by the Japanese authorities. Although she was released, the colonial government responded by closing all schools on March 10 and sent the students home.</p>

        <p>Back at home in Cheonan, Gwan-sun spread word of the protests using a copy of the Declaration of Independence drafted during the movements that she had smuggled out of Seoul. She encouraged others to protest and on April 1 around 3,000 people gathered in Cheonan to protest. The military police came down hard on these protesters, killing 19 (including her parents) and Gwan-sun was, among many others, arrested.</p>
        
        <p>Gwan-sun rejected a lighter sentence that came at the cost of admiting guilt and helping to find others that helped organize the protests. She was convicted of sedition and sent to Seodaemun Prison. While in prison, she would continue to fight for Korea's independece and organized protests with other prisoners. This ultimately resulted in her being placed in an underground cell, where she was beaten and tortured.</p>
        
        <p>Shortly before her death from the injures resulting from her torture, she was still fighting for her cause, writing "Japan will fall". She died on September 28, 1920, at only 17 years old.</p>
        
        <p>The protests of 1919 and the sacrifices of Yu Gwan-sun and many others did not immediately result in Korea's indepence, which wouldn't come until 1945, but Japan did relax their political control over the peninsula. Today, Gwan-sun is a Korean national hero and her story is both an example to the strength of humanity to fight for something they truly care for as well as the horrors humanity is capable of.</p>
